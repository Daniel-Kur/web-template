# Web Project Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate for starting web projects using **Vite**, **React**, **TypeScript**, and includes **Tailwind CSS** for styling and **Shadcn UI** for ready-to-use UI components. It is structured to help kick-start your projects with these modern technologies.

## Technologies Used

- **Vite**: A fast build tool for modern web projects.
- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that helps with better tooling and type safety.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling your components.
- **Shadcn UI**: A set of components built on top of Radix UI and Tailwind CSS for consistent, reusable UI elements.
